# The ZAP version is automatically updated by zaproxy/zap-admin repo.

title: Latest Versions
info:
  - We maintain a page containing XML with links to the latest ZAP release files
  - You can use this to automatically pull down the latest ZAP release for the platform you need.
  - ZAP uses similar URLs when checking for updates.
  - These are version specific and define the add-on on the ZAP Marketplace for that release stream.
  - The 2.10 release stream uses [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zaproxy/zap-admin/master/ZapVersions-2.10.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zaproxy/zap-admin/master/ZapVersions-2.10.xml)
  - The development code uses [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zaproxy/zap-admin/master/ZapVersions-dev.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zaproxy/zap-admin/master/ZapVersions-dev.xml)
  - These files are usually the same, but it does allow us to release add-ons which depend on core features which have been added since the current stable release.
