title: ZAP Weekly
info:
  - We generate weekly releases of ZAP from the [main](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy) branch, typically every Monday.
  - These are just intended for people who want to use all of the features we've added since the last 'full' release but don't want the hassle of building ZAP from the source code.
  - While we endeavor to ensure that weekly releases are robust, things may be broken or only partially implemented.
  - It is cross platform (Windows, Linux and macOS) but does not include any installers.
  - It requires Java 8 or higher to run.
