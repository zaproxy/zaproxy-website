To add a script you'll need to use the following [command line](/docs/desktop/cmdline) options (with the
values changed to match your requirements of course;)

    -config script.scripts.name="Remove Strict-Transport-Security"
    -config script.scripts.engine="Mozilla Zest"
    -config script.scripts.type=proxy
    -config script.scripts.enabled=true
    -config script.scripts.file="/home/user/scripts/Remove Strict-Transport-Security.zst"
