First of all try checking the 'Enable unsafe SSL/TLS renegotiation' checkbox
in the Certificate Options screen and trying again.

Second check if you've enabled SSLv2Hello in the outbound [connection
options](/docs/desktop/ui/dialogs/options/connection/). If so, disable SSLv2Hello and
reload the content to see if the issue is resolved.

If this doesn't help and an HTTPS site reports a handshake failure then try
installing the 'Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength
Jurisdiction Policy Files':

- Java 8 : <https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce8-download-2133166.html>
- Java 9 : Should not require the JCE Policy Files, per [JDK 9 Readme](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/terms/readme/jdk9-readme-3852447.html#jce) (as reviewed 20171212):

> The default JCE policy files bundled in this Java Runtime Environment allow
> for "unlimited" cryptographic strengths.

You will need to restart ZAP for these to take effect.

Note that on OS X we include the JRE with the ZAP application, so you'll need
to start ZAP with an installed JRE from the command line, or you can edit
`zap.sh` located under `/Applications/OWASP ZAP.app/Contents/Java` and comment
out the statement shown below(as of version 2.5.0), the script will launch
automatically using the JRE from the system:

```bash
#if [ "$OS" = "Darwin" ]; then
#  if [ -e ../PlugIns/jre*/Contents/Home/bin/java ]; then
#    pushd ../PlugIns/jre*/Contents/Home/bin > /dev/null
#    JAVA_PATH=`pwd -P`
#    PATH="$JAVA_PATH:$PATH"
#    popd > /dev/null
#  fi
#fi
```

Java 8 users note you may encounter SSLHandshakeException, on sites that
support RC4 ciphers. More info
[here](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/1892#issuecomment-139906996),
and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32009083/javax-net-ssl-sslhandshakeexception-handshake-failure-when-using-jmeter-with-ss).
Solution(s): Disable RC4 on the server.

If you're in a corporate or business environment that normally requires the
use of an Enterprise proxy you can have ZAP use it as well via the [Options :
Connections screen](/docs/desktop/ui/dialogs/options/connection/). If ZAP can't actually get to the
destination (because use of the corporate proxy is required) this can
sometimes manifest as an SSL/TLS negotiation failure.

If this doesn't help then get in touch via the [User
Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/zaproxy-users).

## Error "java.lang.RuntimeException: Could not generate DH keypair"

The error and the likely cause is described in
[#2626](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/2626): Java 8 does not
support DH parameters with more than 2048 bit. It works with Java 9 (Debian: Install `openjdk-9-jre`).
