You have 3 options:

  1. Convince one of the existing ZAP developers that they should implement it
  2. Convince someone else to implement it for you
  3. Implement it yourself

Some of the ZAP core developers are paid to work on ZAP. If you can convince
one of the us that we should implement it asap then this will probably be the
quickest option as obviously we know the code base well. However we are all
very busy and the companies who pay us have expectations on what we will
deliver. We do have a lot of freedom to do what we think is right, but we all
have a long list of things we'd really like to work on. But it doesnt hurt to
try.

Failing that you can try to convince someone else to implement it for you. The
ZAP Developer Group (<https://groups.google.com/group/zaproxy-develop>) is a
good place to find people interested in working on ZAP. The Bounty Source
(<https://www.bountysource.com/teams/zap/issues>) site allows you to put
bounties on ZAP features, so that might be a suitable incentive for someone.

And the final option is to implement it yourself.

We, the ZAP core team, will do our best to support anyone who wants to
contribute to ZAP. We often spend more time helping other people implement a
feature than it would take us to implement it ourselves. We do this because we
want to encourage people to get involved in ZAP, and we think its a good
investment in our time. It doesnt matter to us why people want to get involved
- if its just because someone else is paying them then thats fine.
