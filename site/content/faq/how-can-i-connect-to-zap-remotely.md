By default ZAP will now also only allow connections from the local machine.
You can set which IP addresses can connect to the API using the command line:

    -config api.addrs.addr.name=123.456.789.123

If you are using ZAP in a completely isolated environment you can allow all IP
addresses to connect to the ZAP API using:

    -config api.addrs.addr.name=.* -config api.addrs.addr.regex=true

You will also need to set or disable the API key - see the FAQ: [Why is an API
key required by default?](/faq/why-is-an-api-key-required-by-default/)

If you still have problems connecting then look in the `zap.log` file for any
error messages as per the FAQ: [Somethings not working - what should I
do?](/faq/somethings-not-working-what-should-i-do/)
