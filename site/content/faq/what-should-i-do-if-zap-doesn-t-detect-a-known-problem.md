If ZAP fails to detect a known problem then please let us know!

Obviously the more information you can give us the better, and the best option
would be a simple one page 'proof of concept' in the form of a
[wavsep](https://github.com/sectooladdict/wavsep) test - we can then include
those in our regression tests.

You can let us know via:

- A [new issue](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/new)
- The [developers group](https://groups.google.com/group/zaproxy-develop)
- A private email to psiinon at gmail dot com
