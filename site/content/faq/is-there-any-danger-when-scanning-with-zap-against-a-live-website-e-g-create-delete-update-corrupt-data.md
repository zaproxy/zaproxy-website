Proxying (and therefore passive scanning) requests via ZAP is completely safe
and legal, it just allows you to see whats going on.

Spidering is a bit more dangerous. It could cause problems depending on how
your application works.

Note that there is an Spider option to not use POST requests - this may be
safer but is also likely to reduce the effectiveness of the Spider.

Active scanning is dangerous and depending on your app may
create/modify/delete data.

So the only really safe thing is proxying and passive scanning, the other 2
could cause problems and could be considered illegal if you perform them on
apps you don't have permission to test.

ZAP supports a 'safe' [mode](/docs/desktop/start/features/modes/) which will only allow you to do safe things,
as well as a 'protected' mode which only allows you to attack sites that you
define are in [scope](/docs/desktop/start/features/scope/). We recommend you use either of these modes
whenever you are using ZAP with a site that you do not want to attack.
