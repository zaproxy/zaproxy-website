ZAP should run on all operating systems that support Java 8 - it can even run
on a [Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/wiki/zappi)!

Note that the ZAP macOS release includes Java 8 (since ZAP 2.5.0) with it and
should run without any problems on older Macs like OS X 10.6.8.

If you experience any problems running ZAP then please report them to us.
