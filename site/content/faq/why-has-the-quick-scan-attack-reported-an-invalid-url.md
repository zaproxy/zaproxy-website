If the Quick Start Attack fails with the message:

    Failed to attack the URL, please check that the URL is valid

then the first thing to do is check your URL in a browser.

If it works ok then open the ZAP [Manual Request
Editor](/docs/desktop/ui/dialogs/man_req/),
replace the default URL with the one you are trying and send the request.

The response may well explain the problem.

Browsers will try variations of a URL that ZAP will not attempt, and we have
also seen sites blocking ZAP scans based on the request signature.

In the latter case scanning the sites using a proxied request rather than
using the Quick Start Attack button was successful.

### HTTPS Sites

Are sometimes impacted by items covered in the [SSL
FAQ](/faq/how-to-connect-to-an-https-site-that-reports-a-handshake-failure/) resulting in
failures when using Quick Scan.
