As discussed in https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/5469, this issue seems to occur when laptops are docked. (The work around is to un-dock your system.)

This is the same as https://github.com/oracle/visualvm/issues/84 which links to https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8223158

This issue is unfortunately outside the control of the ZAP team.
