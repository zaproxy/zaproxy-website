ZAP is installed in different places depending on the OS:

##  Windows 7

Underneath the 'Program Files (x86)' directory, e.g.

    
    
    C:\Program Files (x86)\OWASP\Zed Attack Proxy
    

##  Windows XP

Underneath the 'Program Files' directory, e.g.

    
    
    C:\Program Files\OWASP\Zed Attack Proxy
    

##  Linux

The Linux package is actually just a tar.gz file, so ZAP will be 'installed'
wherever you expand the archive.

##  Mac OS

Same as for Linux, the Mac OS package is just a zip file. The contained "Owasp
ZAP" app can be executed instantly, regardless of the directory. As for any
other Mac application, most users preferably put the app into the
/Applications directory.
