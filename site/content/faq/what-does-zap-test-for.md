ZAP supports:

- HTTP [active](/docs/desktop/start/features/ascan/) and [passive](/docs/desktop/start/features/pscan/) scanning.
- WebSockets [passive](/docs/desktop/addons/websockets/pscanrules/) scanning.

For a full list of the HTTP active and passive scan rules see the [Alert Details](/docs/alerts/) page.

By default ZAP comes with the following (HTTP) 'release' quality rules:

- [Release Active Scan Rules](/docs/desktop/addons/active-scan-rules/)
- [Release Passive Scan Rules](/docs/desktop/addons/passive-scan-rules/)
