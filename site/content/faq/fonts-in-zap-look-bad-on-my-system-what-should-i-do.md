This seems to come up on various Linux distros from time to time. For example:
<https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/3051>

The following suggestions may let you work past the issue.

1. Try starting ZAP from the [command line](/docs/desktop/cmdline/) instead of starting it from a shortcut (such as a Plasma/KDE button, dock icon, etc.)
2. Try adding the following to `/etc/environment`:


    _JAVA_OPTIONS='-Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=on'
