The following students have completed projects which have significantly improved ZAP.

To qualify for this list students must complete a non trivial project and have their work either included in 
the ZAP core or in an add-on that has been published on the [Marketplace](/addons/). Projects that are not published 
by the time the students have finished can still qualify to be included if someone else completes their work and 
publishes it for them.

Note that significant non code projects, such as documentation, also qualify.

If you would like to work on ZAP as part of a student project then just post to the [ZAP Developer Group](https://groups.google.com/group/zaproxy-develop).
