A new and ongoing [set of videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEBitBW-HlsvFEfyWdpLe6IlQoitjaPCX) focusing on ZAP features, new and old.

Subtitles are available for all except for the latest videos - these are also available in the ZAP
[zap-media-resources](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-media-resources/tree/main/subtitles/ZAP%20Chat) repo.
This means that YouTube should auto-translate to other languages much more accurately.

These were transcribed by [blinkz](https://twitter.com/blinkZ03272259) who has published a video on how that can be done: 
[Tutorial: Create subtitles with Whisper for Youtube and others](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-GIz4XTP3Y) -
it is in German, but obviously has great subtitles :grin:.
