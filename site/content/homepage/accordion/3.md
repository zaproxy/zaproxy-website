ZAP can be configured to run many additional automated tests via free add-ons and extensions. Examples of semi-automated support includes:

1. Access Control Testing
2. Active Scanner rules
3. Passive Scanner rules
4. Community Scripts

ZAP's powerful API allows extensions to customize ZAP and integrate it with other tools. In this way ZAP can be used to automate security scanning at scale.
