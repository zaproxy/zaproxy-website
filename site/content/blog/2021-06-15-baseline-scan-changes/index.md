![Using the Automation Framework](images/baseline-af.png)

We are changing the [baseline scan](/docs/docker/baseline-scan/) (and the other packaged scans in time) to use the new [Automation Framework](/docs/automate/automation-framework/) (AF).

Hopefully the changes will not affect any of you who use it but we want to make sure that you understand what has changed and what to do if you think it is not working.

We would also like you to try it out as soon as possible and to [report any issues](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues) to us.

The current status is:

- [live](https://hub.docker.com/r/owasp/zap2docker-live/) docker image - AF used only if **explicitly enabled**
- [weekly](https://hub.docker.com/r/owasp/zap2docker-weekly/) docker image - AF used only if **explicitly enabled**
- [stable](https://hub.docker.com/r/owasp/zap2docker-stable/) docker image - AF will **not** be used (this will only be changed at the next full release)

## Change Summary

Depending on which options you choose the baseline scan may now use the new [Automation Framework](/docs/automate/automation-framework/) (AF) instead of controlling ZAP via the API. This is part of an ongoing development to migrate all of the packaged scans to use the AF.

Initially the AF has to be explicitly enabled using the `--auto` baseline scan option.
We would encourage everyone who uses the baseline scan to try this out and [report any issues](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues) to us.

We will be enabling the AF as soon as we are happy that there are no breaking changes, at which point the `--auto` flag will be ignored.
However you will be able to use the new `--autooff` flag to disable it.

Not all of the baseline options are currently supported by the AF which is why it will depend on the options you use - if you use any options not supported by the AF then the baseline will work as before, even if `--auto` is specified.

We are continually enhancing the AF so more baseline options will become supported in the coming weeks - this is an ongoing process and will therefore not warrant further blog posts :)

To see exactly which parameters are supported see the source code https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/blob/main/docker/zap-baseline.py

## Output Differences

If the AF is used for the baseline scan then the following line will be included in the output:

```
Using the Automation Framework
```

If you use the `-d` option to output diagnostic messages then these will differ significantly as the underlying mechanisms have changed.

If the AF reports any errors or warnings then these will be reported in a different way:

{{< terminal "docker run owasp/zap2docker-weekly zap-baseline.py -t https://www.example.bad --auto" >}}2021-06-10 11:08:44,764 Could not find custom hooks file at /home/zap/.zap_hooks.py
2021-06-10 11:08:53,809 Failed to access summary file /zap/zap_out.json
Using the Automation Framework
Automation plan failures:
Job spider failed to access URL https://www.example.bad check that it is valid : www.example.bad
{{< /terminal >}}

If you map a drive to `/zap/wrk` and if the AF is used then it will copy the `zap.yaml` job configuration file into the drive you have mapped. This can be used to migrate away from the packaged scans to take full advantage of the new features we will be adding to the AF.

An example yaml file generated by the command:

```
docker run -v $(pwd):/zap/wrk/:rw -t owasp/zap2docker-weekly zap-baseline.py -t https://www.example.com -j --auto
```

```yaml
env:
  contexts:
    - name: baseline
      urls:
        - https://www.example.com
  parameters:
    failOnError: true
    progressToStdout: false
jobs:
  - install:
      - pscanrulesBeta
    type: addOns
    uninstall: []
  - parameters:
      enableTags: false
      maxAlertsPerRule: 10
    type: passiveScan-config
  - parameters:
      maxDuration: 1
      url: https://www.example.com
    type: spider
  - parameters:

      url: https://www.example.com
    type: spiderAjax
  - parameters:

    type: passiveScan-wait
  - parameters:
      format: Long
      summaryFile: /zap/zap_out.json
    type: outputSummary
```

Note that we will not be getting rid of the packaged scans, but the AF will provide more features and flexibility.

As you will see, in this case the AF reports one more issue than the non-AF case.

## Reverting to the Original Baseline

If you experience any problems with the AF then please let us know asap.
While we are resolving them then you can use the new `--autooff` option which will disable the AF.

Please note that this is a temporary option that will only be available while we are in the process of migrating the scripts. At some point this option will be removed so you must tell us if you experience any problems.
