## Announcing the First Ever ZAPCon!

Today we are calling for topics and speakers in the first-ever OWASP ZAP User Conference!

This will be heavily focused on using ZAP at scale and Application Security practices.

Do you have a story to tell about how you use ZAP inside your company or a sweet ZAP tweak that made ZAP sing? Other ZAP users would love to hear about it!
