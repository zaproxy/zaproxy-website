OK, OK, it's been a long time since the last ZAP blog post.
But we certainly have not been idle - since that last blog post we've published 3 full ZAP releases, well over 100 weekly releases and a shiny new web site: [https://zaproxy.org/](/)

Because we now have a new website we've decided to move our blog from [https://zaproxy.blogspot.com/](https://zaproxy.blogspot.com/) to [https://zaproxy.org/blog/](/blog/).
As part of that move all of the old blog posts have been moved to the new site and updated to fix some of the links that had broken.

So while this blog post is appearing on both Blogger and the ZAP website this will be the last blog post on Blogger - all future blog posts will be on [https://zaproxy.org/blog/](/blog/).

We are planning a whole series of new blog posts - if you want to be notified when they are published then either:

- Follow [@zaproxy](https://twitter.com/zaproxy) on Twitter
- Join the [ZAP User Group](https://groups.google.com/group/zaproxy-users)

If you have any comments or questions about this then please post them to this [ZAP User Group thread](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/zaproxy-users/QCP-yg4_cy8/eZS5sQFKCQAJ).
