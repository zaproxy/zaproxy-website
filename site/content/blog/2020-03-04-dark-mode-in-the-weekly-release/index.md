We release ZAP every week: [https://www.zaproxy.org/download/#weekly](/download/#weekly)

We’re happy to announce that this week’s release includes the first steps towards an all new **dark mode** for the ZAP Desktop UI:

It’s early days - not all screens use suitable colours, but it should be mostly usable.
To enable it in the weekly release:

1. Open up the ZAP Options
1. Select the Display screen
1. Select either ‘Flat Dark’ or ‘Flat Darcula’
1. Restart ZAP

Many thanks to [@JFormDesigner](https://twitter.com/JFormDesigner) for the [FlatLaf](https://github.com/JFormDesigner/FlatLaf) Look and Feel which adds this feature to ZAP.
