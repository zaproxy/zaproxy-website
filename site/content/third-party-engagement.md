- Third parties are encouraged to be public about their use of ZAP and to contribute back fixes and enhancements
- Third parties should not use "ZAP" or "ZAPROXY" in their product names
- Third party specific add-ons can be added to the ZAP Marketplace as long as the add-ons are free and Open Source and it is clear who developed/supports them. Any services those add-ons connect to can be Open Source, closed source, free or commercial
- Third party specific add-ons will not be included in the official ZAP distributions
  - Exceptions may be made by the ZAP core team, for example add-ons which connect to commonly used components like bug trackers
