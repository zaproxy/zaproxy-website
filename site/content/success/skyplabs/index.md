SkypLabs is an Ireland-based company providing a wide range of IT services
globally, including security reviews and penetration testing. Created in 2021,
we have since worked with many different organisations to help them build and
secure their work.

ZAP is our main tool when conducting web application penetration tests,
and we also use it when analysing the web trafic of desktop and mobile
applications. Besides its versatility and [unique features compared to
competitors][burp-missing-features], as being a company focusing on open-source
and user-respecting software, we love being able to contribute to projects
that share our values. We have, for instance, added the possibility to [probe
and parse `.DS_Store` files][ds-store-parsing] to automatically discover new
resources on a website with [kingthorin][kingthorin]'s help, and the ability of
searching into notes (that we use a lot during security engagements).

ZAP is also a great asset when it comes to running automatic security scans.
It allows monitoring changes on the web services exposed by an infrastructure.
We encourage our clients to use ZAP as part of a self-hosted security scanning
pipeline that we help them design and set up, and transform their paid
subscription plans to proprietary services, if any, into donations to the ZAP
project. We think it is the most sustainable way to invest into the software
solutions that run businesses.
