When we set out to build StackHawk, we wanted to help teams find and fix vulnerabilities before they deploy to production. As we were building our platform, we needed a scanner that worked for modern development teams. It needed to be easy to automate and be able to test modern single page apps and backing APIs. We picked ZAP because it is best in class for those capabilities. We also loved that ZAP has a very rich open source community
