### Type: Passive Scan

### Description
A cookie has been set without the SameSite attribute, which means that the cookie can be sent as a result of a 'cross-site' request. The SameSite attribute is an effective counter measure to cross-site request forgery, cross-site script inclusion, and timing attacks.

### Solution

Ensure that the SameSite attribute is set to either 'lax' or ideally 'strict' for all cookies.
