The web/application server is leaking the application it uses as a webserver via the "Server" HTTP response header. Access to such information may facilitate attackers identifying other vulnerabilities your web/application server is subject to. This information alone, i.e. without a version string, is not very dangerous for the security of a server, nevertheless this information in the response header field is almost always useless and thus just an obsolete attacking vector.
