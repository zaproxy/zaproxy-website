### Type: Passive Scan

### Description
A cookie has been set without the HttpOnly flag, which means that the cookie can be accessed by JavaScript. If a malicious script can be run on this page then the cookie will be accessible and can be transmitted to another site. If this is a session cookie then session hijacking may be possible.

### Solution

Ensure that the HttpOnly flag is set for all cookies.
