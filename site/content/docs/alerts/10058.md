## Name: GET for POST

### Type: Active Scan Rule

### Risk: Informational

### Description

A request that was originally observed as a POST was also accepted as a GET. This issue does not represent a security weakness unto itself, however, it may facilitate simplification of other attacks. For example if the original POST is subject to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), then this finding may indicate that a simplified (GET based) XSS may also be possible.

### Solution

Ensure that only POST is accepted where POST is expected.

### CWE: [16](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/16.html)

### WASC:  20
