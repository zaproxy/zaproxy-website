A request that was originally observed as a POST was also accepted as a GET. This issue does not represent a security weakness unto itself, however, it may facilitate simplification of other attacks. For example if the original POST is subject to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), then this finding may indicate that a simplified (GET based) XSS may also be possible.
