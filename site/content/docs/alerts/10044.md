## Name: Big Redirect Detected (Potential Sensitive Information Leak)

### Type: Passive Scan Rule


### Description

The server has responded with a redirect that seems to provide a large response. This may indicate that although the server sent a redirect it also responded with body content (which may include sensitive details, PII, etc.).

### Solution

Ensure that no sensitive information is leaked via redirect responses. Redirect responses should have almost no content.

### Code

 * [org/zaproxy/zap/extension/pscanrulesBeta/BigRedirectsScanRule.java](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-extensions/blob/master/addOns/pscanrulesBeta/src/main/java/org/zaproxy/zap/extension/pscanrulesBeta/BigRedirectsScanRule.java)
