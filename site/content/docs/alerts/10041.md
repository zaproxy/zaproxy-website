## Name: HTTP to HTTPS Insecure Transition in Form Post

### Type: Passive Scan Rule


### Description

This check looks for insecure HTTP pages that host HTTPS forms. The issue is that an insecure HTTP page can easily be hijacked through MITM and the secure HTTPS form can be replaced or spoofed.

### Solution

Use HTTPS for landing pages that host secure forms.

### Code
