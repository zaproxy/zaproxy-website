The byterange filter in earlier versions of the Apache HTTP Server allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory and CPU exhaustion) via a Range request header that identifies multiple overlapping ranges. This issue was exploited in the wild in August 2011.

## Deprecated: 2020-06-13

Produced too many false positives and is no longer relevant.
