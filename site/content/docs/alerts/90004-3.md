title: "Insufficient Site Isolation Against Spectre Vulnerability"
alertid: 90004-3
alertindex: 9000403
alerttype: "Passive"
alertcount: 3
status: beta
type: alert
risk: Low
solution: "Ensure that the application/web server sets the Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy header appropriately, and that it sets the Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy header to 'same-origin' for documents. 'same-origin-allow-popups' is considered as less secured and should be avoided. If possible, ensure that the end user uses a standards-compliant and modern web browser that supports the Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy header (https://caniuse.com/mdn-http_headers_cross-origin-opener-policy)."

Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy header is a response header that allows a site to control if others included documents share the same browsing context. Sharing the same browsing context with untrusted documents might lead to data leak.
