A HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) header was found, but it contains the directive max-age=0 which disables the control and instructs browsers to reset any previous HSTS related settings. See RFC 6797 for further details.
HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a web security policy mechanism whereby a web server declares that complying user agents (such as a web browser) are to interact with it using only secure HTTPS connections (i.e. HTTP layered over TLS/SSL).
