### Type: Passive Scan

### Description
Base64 encoded data was disclosed by the application/web server. Note: in the interests of performance not all base64 strings in the response were analyzed individually, the entire response should be looked at by the analyst/security team/developer(s).

### Solution

Manually confirm that the Base64 data does not leak sensitive information, and that the data cannot be aggregated/used to exploit other vulnerabilities.
