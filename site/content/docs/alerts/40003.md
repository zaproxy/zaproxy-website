### Type: Active Scan

### Risk: Medium

### Description

Cookie can be set via CRLF injection.  It may also be possible to set arbitrary HTTP response headers. In addition, by carefully crafting the injected response using cross-site script, cache poisoning vulnerability may also exist.

### Solution

Type check the submitted parameter carefully.  Do not allow CRLF to be injected by filtering CRLF.
