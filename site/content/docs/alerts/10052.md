### Type: Passive Scan

### Description
The server is leaking information through the X-ChromeLogger-Data (or X-ChromePhp-Data) response header. The content of such headers can be customized by the developer, however it is not uncommon to find: server file system locations, vhost declarations, etc.

### Solution

Disable this functionality in Production when it might leak information that could be leveraged by an attacker. Alternatively ensure that use of the functionality is tied to a strong authorization check and only available to administrators or support personnel for troubleshooting purposes not general users.
