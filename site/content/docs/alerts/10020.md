## Name: X-Frame-Options Header Not Set

### Type: Passive Scan Rule

### Risk: Medium

### Description

X-Frame-Options header is not included in the HTTP response to protect against 'ClickJacking' attacks.

### Solution

Most modern Web browsers support the X-Frame-Options HTTP header. Ensure it's set on all web pages returned by your site (if you expect the page to be framed only by pages on your server (e.g. it's part of a FRAMESET) then you'll want to use SAMEORIGIN, otherwise if you never expect the page to be framed, you should use DENY. ALLOW-FROM allows specific websites to frame the web page in supported web browsers).

## Name: Multiple X-Frame-Options Header Entries

### Risk: Medium

### Description

## Name: X-Frame-Options Defined via META (Non-compliant with Spec)

### Risk: Medium

### Description

### Solution

## Name: X-Frame-Options Setting Malformed

### Risk: Medium

### Description

An X-Frame-Options header was present in the response but the value was not correctly set.

### Solution

Ensure a valid setting is used on all web pages returned by your site (if you expect the page to be framed only by pages on your server (e.g. it's part of a FRAMESET) then you'll want to use SAMEORIGIN, otherwise if you never expect the page to be framed, you should use DENY. ALLOW-FROM allows specific websites to frame the web page in supported web browsers).
