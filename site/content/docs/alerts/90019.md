alertindex: 9001900
alerttype: "Active"
alertcount: 1
status: release
type: alert
risk: High
solution: "Do not trust client side input, even if there is client side validation in place.
In general, type check all data on the server side and escape all data received from the client.
 Avoid the use of eval() functions combined with user input data."
