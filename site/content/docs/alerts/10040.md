## Name: Secure Pages Include Mixed Content

### Type: Passive Scan Rule


### Description

The page includes mixed content, that is content accessed via HTTP instead of HTTPS.

The page must not contain any content that is transmitted over unencrypted HTTP.
 This includes content from third party sites.
