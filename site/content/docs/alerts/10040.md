### Type: Passive Scan

### Description
The page includes mixed content, that is content accessed via HTTP instead of HTTPS.

### Solution

A page that is available over SSL/TLS must be comprised completely of content which is transmitted over SSL/TLS.
The page must not contain any content that is transmitted over unencrypted HTTP.
 This includes content from third party sites.
