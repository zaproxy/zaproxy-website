The image was found to contain embedded location information, such as GPS coordinates, or another privacy exposure, such as camera serial number.  Depending on the context of the image in the website, this information may expose private details of the users of a site.  For example, a site that allows users to upload profile pictures taken in the home may expose the home's address.
