ZAP provides the following HTTP passive and active scan rules which find specific vulnerabilities.

Note that these are examples of the alerts raised - many rules include different details depending on the exact problem encountered. 

Only the `release` rules are included in ZAP by default, the beta and alpha rules can be installed via the [ZAP Marketplace](/addons/).

You can also use HTTP passive and active scripts, examples of which are available in the ZAP [community scripts](https://github.com/zaproxy/community-scripts) repo, as well as Websocket [passive](/docs/desktop/addons/websockets/pscanrules/) scripts.
