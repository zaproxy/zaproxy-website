### Type: Passive Scan

### Description
The web/application server is leaking information via one or more "X-Powered-By" HTTP response headers. Access to such information may facilitate attackers identifying other frameworks/components your web application is reliant upon and the vulnerabilities such components may be subject to.

### Solution

Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is configured to suppress "X-Powered-By" headers.
