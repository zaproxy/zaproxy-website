## Name: Feature Policy Header Not Set

### Type: Passive Scan Rule


### Description

Feature Policy Header is an added layer of security that helps to restrict from unauthorized access or usage of browser/client features by web resources. This policy ensures the user privacy by limiting or specifying the features of the browsers can be used by the web resources. Feature Policy provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to limit which features of browsers can be used by the page such as camera, microphone, location, full screen etc.

### Solution

Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is configured to set the Feature-Policy header.
