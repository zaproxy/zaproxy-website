solution: "Ensure a valid setting is used on all web pages returned by your site (if you expect the page to be framed only by pages on your server (e.g. it's part of a FRAMESET) then you'll want to use SAMEORIGIN, otherwise if you never expect the page to be framed, you should use DENY.  Alternatively consider implementing Content Security Policy's 'frame-ancestors' directive."
