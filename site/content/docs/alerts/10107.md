The server initiated a proxied request via the proxy specified in the HTTP Proxy header of the request.Httpoxy typically affects code running in CGI or CGI like environments.
This may allow attackers to:
* Proxy the outgoing HTTP requests made by the web application
* Direct the server to open outgoing connections to an address and port of their choosing or
* Tie up server resources by forcing the vulnerable software to use a malicious proxy
