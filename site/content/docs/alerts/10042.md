### Type: Passive Scan

### Description
This check identifies secure HTTPS pages that host insecure HTTP forms. The issue is that a secure page is transitioning to an insecure page when data is uploaded through a form. The user may think they're submitting data to a secure page when in fact they are not.

### Solution

Ensure sensitive data is only sent over secured HTTPS channels.
