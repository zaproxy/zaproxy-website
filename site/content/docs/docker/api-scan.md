The ZAP API scan is a script that is available in the ZAP [Docker](../about/) images.

It is tuned for performing scans against APIs defined by OpenAPI, SOAP, or GraphQL via either a local file or a URL.

It imports the definition that you specify and then runs an Active Scan against the URLs found.
The Active Scan is tuned to APIs, so it doesn't bother looking for things like XSSs.

It also includes 2 scripts that:

- Raise alerts for any HTTP Server Error response codes
- Raise alerts for any URLs that return content types that are not usually associated with APIs

### Usage

```
Usage: zap-api-scan.py -t <target> -f <format> [options]
    -t target         target API definition, OpenAPI or SOAP, local file or URL, e.g. https://www.example.com/openapi.json
                      or target endpoint URL, GraphQL, e.g. https://www.example.com/graphql
    -f format         openapi, soap, or graphql
Options:
    -h                print this help message
    -c config_file    config file to use to INFO, IGNORE or FAIL warnings
    -u config_url     URL of config file to use to INFO, IGNORE or FAIL warnings
    -g gen_file       generate default config file (all rules set to WARN)
    -r report_html    file to write the full ZAP HTML report
    -w report_md      file to write the full ZAP Wiki (Markdown) report
    -x report_xml     file to write the full ZAP XML report
    -J report_json    file to write the full ZAP JSON document
    -a                include the alpha passive scan rules as well
    -d                show debug messages
    -P                specify listen port
    -D                delay in seconds to wait for passive scanning
    -i                default rules not in the config file to INFO
    -I                do not return failure on warning (post 2.9.0)
    -l level          minimum level to show: PASS, IGNORE, INFO, WARN or FAIL, use with -s to hide example URLs
    -n context_file   context file which will be loaded prior to scanning the target
    -p progress_file  progress file which specifies issues that are being addressed
    -s                short output format - dont show PASSes or example URLs
    -S                safe mode this will skip the active scan and perform a baseline scan
    -T                max time in minutes to wait for ZAP to start and the passive scan to run
    -U user           username to use for authenticated scans - must be defined in the given context file (post 2.9.0)
    -O                the hostname to override in the (remote) OpenAPI spec
    -z zap_options    ZAP command line options e.g. -z "-config aaa=bbb -config ccc=ddd"
    --hook            path to python file that define your custom hooks
```

### Configuration

The configuration works in a very similar way as the [Baseline Scan](../baseline-scan/) so see the Baseline page for more details.

### Configuration File

You can configure how the API scan runs with a configuration file. A default configuration file can be created using the '-g' parameter.
Unlike the baseline configuration file the API configuration file handles both active and passive scan rules.

```
# zap-api-scan rule configuration file
# Change WARN to IGNORE to ignore rule or FAIL to fail if rule matches
# Active scan rules set to IGNORE will not be run which will speed up the scan
# Only the rule identifiers are used - the names are just for info
# You can add your own messages to each rule by appending them after a tab on each line.

### Scan Hooks

This script supports [scan hooks](../scan-hooks/) which allow you to override or modify behaviour of the script components instead of having to write a new script.

### Source Code

The source code for this script is in [https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/tree/main/docker](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/tree/main/docker).
