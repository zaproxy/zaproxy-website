The HUD is an extension to ZAP, so to run the HUD you need to first start ZAP. There are two ways to start ZAP:
1. Run from HUD directory with gradle

```
git clone https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-hud.git
cd zap-hud
./gradlew runZap
```

2. Download ZAP from https://www.zaproxy.org/download/

After starting ZAP press "Manually Explore", make sure the "Enable HUD" checkbox is checked, and press "Start Browsing" to launch a browser with the HUD enabled.
