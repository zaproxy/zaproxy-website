# OWASP ZAP Desktop User Guide

Welcome to the OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) Desktop User Guide.

This is available both as context sensitive help within ZAP and online at
[https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/desktop/](/docs/desktop/)

ZAP is an easy to use integrated penetration testing tool for finding vulnerabilities in web applications.

It is designed to be used by people with a wide range of security experience and as such is ideal for
developers and functional testers who are new to penetration testing.

ZAP provides automated scanners as well as a set of tools that allow you to find security vulnerabilities manually.

ZAP can also be run in a completely automated way - see the [ZAP website](/) for more details.

If you are new to ZAP then its recommended that you look at the [Getting Started](/docs/desktop/start/) section.

ZAP is a fork of the open source variant of the [Paros Proxy](/docs/desktop/paros/).
