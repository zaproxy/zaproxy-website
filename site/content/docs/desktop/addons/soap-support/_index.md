# SOAP Support

This add-on imports and scans WSDL files containing SOAP endpoints.

It also supports the [Automation Framework](/docs/desktop/addons/soap-support/automation/).

## Importing

The add-on will automatically detect any SOAP definitions and spider them as long as they are in scope.

2 menu items are also added to the Import menu:

- Import a WSDL file from local file system
- Import a WSDL file from a URL

These operations are also available via the API.

**NOTE:** As of version 6 of this add-on, only encoded URLs are supported.
