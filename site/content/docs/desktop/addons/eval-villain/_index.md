# Eval Villain

This add-on adds the Eval Villain extension to Firefox when launched from ZAP.  
Eval Villain is a web extension for Firefox that will hook dangerous functions, like eval, and warn you of their use.

For more details see the ZAP blog post [The Eval Villain Add-on](/blog/2021-12-01-the-eval-villain-add-on/) and the
[Eval Villain homepage](https://github.com/swoops/eval_villain).

Click on the Eval Villain button in the Firefox toolbar to start using it.
