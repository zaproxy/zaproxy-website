# Payloads dialog

This allows you to select the payload generators to use when [fuzzing](/docs/desktop/addons/fuzzer/) a request.

Payload generators generate the raw attacks that the fuzzer submits to the target application.

The following types of generators are provided by default:

- Empty/Null - generates the selected payload multiple times, leaving the message without changes. This payload generator is useful to send multiple messages that are later processed, for example, with a [Fuzzer HTTP Processor (Script)](/docs/desktop/addons/fuzzer/httpmessageprocessors/).
- File - select any local file for one off attacks
- File Fuzzers - select any combination of the fuzzing files registered with ZAP, e.g. via add-ons like fuzzdb
- Numberzz - allows to easily generate a sequence of numbers, with custom increment
- Regex - generate attacks based on regex patterns
- Strings - raw strings, which can be entered manually or pasted in
- Script - custom scripts that can generate any payloads required
- Json - generate attacks by fuzzing the provided json

You can write custom payload generator scripts - these can supply any payloads that you need.

Add-ons can also define additional payload generators.

The 'Processors...' button launches the [Payload Processors dialog](/docs/desktop/addons/fuzzer/processors/) which allows you to configure payload processors that just apply to the palyload generator you have selected.
