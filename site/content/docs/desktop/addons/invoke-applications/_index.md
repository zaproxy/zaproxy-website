# Invoke Applications

Other applications can be invoked passing in context information, such as the URL of the
message selected.  
So, for example, Nmap could be invoked passing the site
which you want it to scan.

Applications are configured using the [Options Applications
screen](/docs/desktop/addons/invoke-applications/options/).
