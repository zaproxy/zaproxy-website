# GraphQL Support Script

The GraphQL Support script is responsible for two things:

1. Correctly representing the nodes for a GraphQL request in the sites tree (since ZAP 2.10.0).
2. Adding GraphQL support for Active Scan Input Vectors.

The following sections will elaborate a little on each of these functionalities.

## Sites Tree Representation

Each unique GraphQL request proxied through ZAP is represented in the sites tree. Requests are placed under a common node if they have the same operations. Two queries that have the same fields will be represented by the same node. The only exception is when a query is sent with inline arguments and also using variables. In this case, a prefix of either '0' or '1' is added to distinguish between them respectively.  
For example, the following figure illustrates how two requests may be represented in the sites tree.

## Active Scan Input Vectors

If Active Scan Script Input Vectors are enabled, values are injected for inline arguments in all queries proxied through ZAP. If a query uses variables, then variables are replaced inline and variable definitions are deleted.  
Note that the built-in JSON Input Vector handler also works when a request is sent as JSON.
