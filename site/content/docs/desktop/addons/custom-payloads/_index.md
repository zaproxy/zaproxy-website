# Custom Payloads

This add-on adds an Options panel from which users are able to add, update, remove payloads of their creation/choosing for use by active or passive scan rules which support custom payloads (accessible via the Tools menu Options menu item).


The option panel interface also facilitates addition of multiple payloads from a file.
You can see the Scan Rules which support Custom Payloads [here](/alerttags/custom_payloads/).
