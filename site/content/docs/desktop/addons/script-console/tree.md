# Scripts tree tab

The Scripts tree tab shows you all of the scripts you currently have loaded organized by type.  
It also shows you which templates you have available - these cannot be run directly, you use them to create new scripts.  
It also allows you to add new scripts, load, save and remove them.  
The tab includes a toolbar which allows you to:

- Load a script from filestore
- Save a script to filestore
- Create a new script

Scripts that are run within ZAP components, such as the Active Scanner, can be enabled and disabled via right click menu option.  
All scripts can be removed from the UI via a right click 'Remove Script' menu option.
