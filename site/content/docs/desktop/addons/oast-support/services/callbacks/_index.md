# Callbacks


Various ZAP components (scan rules, etc) may leverage payloads which result in HTTP requests back to ZAP.
Such callback requests may be triggered by the spider(s), a user, or a future action from a tertiary system.


The ZAP GUI includes a panel in which such requests can be reviewed: [OAST tab](/docs/desktop/addons/oast-support/tab/).
