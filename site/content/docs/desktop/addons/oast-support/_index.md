# Out-of-band Application Security Testing Support

The OAST Support add-on allows you to detect and exploit out-of-band vulnerabilities in web applications.

## Services

For a list of the supported services, see the [OAST Services](/docs/desktop/addons/oast-support/services/) page.

## Scripts

If the _Script Console_ and the _GraalVM JavaScript_ add-ons are installed, a new script template called "OAST Register Request Handler.js" is added to ZAP. Using this template, you can create a script that performs an action whenever an out-of-band request is discovered. This action could be anything like sending yourself an email or executing another script in ZAP.
