# Token Generation and Analysis

This add-on allows you to generate and analyse pseudo random tokens, such as those used for session handling or CSRF protection.

To generate and analyse tokens:

- Find a request that contains the token you want to generate
- Right click in the Sites tab or one of the bottom tabs and select 'Generate Tokens...'
- Choose the token you want to generate
- Press the Generate button
- The responses and tokens will then be listed in the 'Token Gen' tab
- When all of the tokens have been generated the 'Analyse Tokens' dialog will be displayed

**Note:** Token generations are not allowed in `Safe` mode nor `Protected` if the message is not in scope.
