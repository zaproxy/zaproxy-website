# Customizable HTML Report

The Customizable HTML Report add-on allows to control the information that goes into the ZAP scanning report. It has three tabs to provide details about the report: Scope, Alerts and Alert Details.

## Scope

Can set the report name, report description and select the template of the HTML output. Additionally, can specify whether to include only contents in scope.  
Report templates:

- **Traditional**: lists all the alerts and sorts them by the risk level from High to Low.
- **Separated Sites**: same as Traditional, but also groups by domain names.
- **Concise**: groups alerts by type (to avoid repetition) and sorts from High to Low.

## Alerts

Can select which alert types to include into the report. Additionally, alerts can be selected or unselected by risk level (Informational, Low, Medium and High).

## Alert Details

Allows to select which alert attributes are included into the Report.  
These are checked and are included by default:

- Description
- Other Info
- Solution
- Reference
- CWE ID
- WASC ID
- Parameter
- Attack
- Evidence

These are unchecked and are excluded by default:

- Request Header
- Response Header
- Request Body
- Response Body
