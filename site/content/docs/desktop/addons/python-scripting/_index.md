# Python Scripting

The Python Scripting add-on allows you to integrate Python scripts in ZAP.  
It's bundled Jython 2.7.2.

When you create a new script you will be given the option to use Python, as well as the option to choose from various Python templates.

Python Scripting is configured using the [Options Jython screen](/docs/desktop/addons/python-scripting/options/).
