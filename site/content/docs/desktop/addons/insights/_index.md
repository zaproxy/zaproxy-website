# Insights Add-on

Insights represent information that is likely to be very relevant to you, but which is not related to vulnerabilities, or potentially even related to the application in question.


Insights tell you more about your applications, about the effectiveness of a scan,
and can even stop a scan early if significant problems are identified.


The add-on includes a full [set of insights](/docs/desktop/addons/insights/insights-list/) built in.

## Automation

## Insights Options

A screen which allows you to configure the Insight [options](/docs/desktop/addons/insights/insights-options/)

## Reports

Insights are available in the ZAP reports.
