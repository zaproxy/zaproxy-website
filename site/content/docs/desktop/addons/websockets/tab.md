# WebSocket tab

The WebSockets tab displays all messages from WebSocket connections.
While ZAP is active, visit e.g.: [Mozilla's BrowserQuest](http://browserquest.mozilla.org/)
to see WebSockets in action.

## Filters

### Channel Selector

You can restrict the display of messages to one specific WebSocket channel or all.  
If you select a specific channel, then the _Show handshake_ button (![](/docs/desktop/addons/websockets/images/handshake.png)) becomes enabled. When you click on it, the corresponding HTTP handshake is shown in the Request/Response tab.

### Filter Dialog

In the filter dialog (![](/docs/desktop/addons/websockets/images/054.png)) you can further control which messages are displayed.

## Breakpoints

You can set custom breakpoints using the _Add Custom Breakpoints_ button (![](/docs/desktop/addons/websockets/images/break_add.png)).  
Alternatively you can use the _Right click menu_ .

## Right click menu

Right clicking on a WebSocket message will bring up a menu which will allow you to:

### Exclude from WebSocket

WebSocket connections can be excluded from the WebSockets tab by adding an excluded URL to the _Session Properties_ . Clicking on this item, brings up the session properties with the URL pre-filled. Excluding a WebSocket connection will not result in closing the connection, but in forwarding them without further processing.

### Break...

This will bring up the _Add Break Point dialog_ which allows you to set up a custom break point.
