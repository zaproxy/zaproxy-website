# Automation Framework - addOns Job

This job has been depreciated, no longer does anything, and should no longer be used.


Previously it allowed you to manage the ZAP add-ons.
However it turns out that adding and updating add-ons when running a plan is a bad idea and does not work well.


For more details on how to manage add-ons see https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/automate/automation-framework/#updating-add-ons


This job will be removed in the next major release of this add-on.
