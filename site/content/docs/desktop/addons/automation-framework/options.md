# Automation Framework - Options

The following options are available:

## Open Last Plan on Start

If selected then the [Automation tab](/docs/desktop/addons/automation-framework/gui/) will automatically load the last plan opened when the GUI starts. This can be useful if you need to regularly use the same plan.


This option has no effect if the desktop GUI is not used.
