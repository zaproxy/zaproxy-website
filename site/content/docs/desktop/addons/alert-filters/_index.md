# Alert Filters


Alert Filters allow you to automatically override the risk levels
of any alerts raised by the active and passive scan.


There are 2 different types of Alert Filter:

* [Context Alert Filters](/docs/desktop/addons/alert-filters/contextalertfilter/)
* [Global Alert Filters](/docs/desktop/addons/alert-filters/globalalertfilter/)

Alert Filters can also be defined in the [Automation Framework](/docs/desktop/addons/alert-filters/automation/).



The easiest way to create Alert Filters is to right click an alert and select
the 'Create Alert Filter...' option. This will display the
[Alert Filter Dialog](/docs/desktop/addons/alert-filters/alertfilterdialog/).  

You can also create Alert Filter manually.
By default Alert Filters only apply to new alerts, but you can both test and apply the Alert Filters to existing alerts.
