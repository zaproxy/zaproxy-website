# Scanner Rules


ZAP supports both [active](/docs/desktop/start/features/ascan/) and 
[passive](/docs/desktop/start/features/pscan/) scanning rules.


All rules are contained in [add-ons](/docs/desktop/start/features/addons/) so that they can be updated quickly and easily.  

By default ZAP ships with just the 'Release' quality rules, but you can install 'Beta' and 'Alpha' quality rules via the
[Manage Add-ons dialog](/docs/desktop/ui/dialogs/manageaddons/).


[Scan Policies](/docs/desktop/start/features/scanpolicy/) define which rules run and how they run.  

You can have as many scan policies as you like to cover different situations.


To manage scan policies open the [Scan Policy Manager dialog](/docs/desktop/ui/dialogs/scanpolicymgr/)
