# Contexts

Contexts are a way of relating a set of URLs together.  
You can define any contexts you like, but it is expected that a context will correspond to
a web application.  
It is recommended that you define a new contexts for each web application
that makes up the system you are testing, and set them in scope as you test each one.

Contexts are defined as a set of regular expressions (regexs) which are applied to all of the URLs in the
[Sites Tree](/docs/desktop/start/features/sitestree/).  
**Note:** The regular expressions must match the whole URL.

You can configure contexts via:

- Right click menu items in the in the Sites or History tab
- The [Session Contexts dialogs](/docs/desktop/ui/dialogs/session/contexts/).
