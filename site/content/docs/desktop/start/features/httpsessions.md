# HTTP Sessions

This tool keeps track of the existing HTTP Sessions on a
particular Site and allows the Zaproxy user to force all requests to
be on a particular session. Basically, it allows the user to easily
switch between user sessions on a Site and to create a new Session
without "destroying" the existing ones.

It is based on the concept of Session Tokens, which are HTTP message
parameters (for now only Cookies) which allow an HTTP server to
connect a request message with any previous requests or data stored.
In the case of Zaproxy, conceptually, session tokens have been
classified into 2 categories: default session tokens and site session
tokens. The default session tokens are the ones that the user can set
in the [Options
screen](/docs/desktop/ui/dialogs/options/httpsessions/) and are tokens that are, by default, automatically considered
session tokens for any site (eg. phpsessid, jsessionid, etc). The site
session tokens are a set of tokens for a particular site and are
usually set up using the popup menus available in the [Params Tab](/docs/desktop/ui/tabs/params/).

This tool automatically detects, using the defined session tokens or
the automatically detected default session tokens, any HTTP session
which exists in the communication. The detected sessions are shown in
the [HTTP Sessions Tab](/docs/desktop/ui/tabs/httpsessions/).

The user can, using the button available on the [HTTP Sessions Tab](/docs/desktop/ui/tabs/httpsessions/), create
a new session without destroying the existing one, or can force one of
the sessions as 'active'. When a session is 'active', all the outbound
requests sent to the corresponding Site are modified, the session
tokens being set up to match the active session. In this way, the user
can easily force some messages to be 'part of' a particular session
and then switch and send messages on another session.

The HTTP Sessions tool is configured using the [HTTP Sessions
Options screen](/docs/desktop/ui/dialogs/options/httpsessions/).
