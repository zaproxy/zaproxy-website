# Scope

The Scope is the set of URLs you are testing, and is defined by the [Contexts](/docs/desktop/start/features/contexts/)
you have specified.

By default nothing is in scope.

The Scope potentially changes:

- What you can do, when you are in Protected [mode](/docs/desktop/start/features/modes/)
- What is shown in the [History tab](/docs/desktop/ui/tabs/history/)
- Protected - user can only perform (potentially) dangerous actions on URLs in the Scope
- Standard - as in previous releases, user can do anything
- ATTACK - new nodes that are in Scope are [actively scanned](/docs/desktop/start/features/ascan/) as soon as they are discovered

It is recommended that you define a new [Context](/docs/desktop/start/features/contexts/) for each web application that makes up the system you are testing, and set them in scope as you test each one.
