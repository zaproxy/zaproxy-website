# Manipulator-in-the-middle Proxy


ZAP is a Manipulator-in-the-middle Proxy. It allows you to see all of the requests you make to a web app
and all of the responses you receive from it.  

Amongst other things this allows you to see AJAX calls that may not otherwise be obvious.


You can also set [breakpoints](/docs/desktop/start/features/breakpoints/) which allow you to change the requests and responses on the fly.
