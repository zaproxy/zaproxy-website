# Notes

A note is any text that you wish to associate with a request.  
For example you could use notes to record details of extra tests that you need to perform on a request.  
Notes are added and changed using the [Add Note dialog](/docs/desktop/ui/dialogs/addnote/).

Notes are flagged in the [History tab](/docs/desktop/ui/tabs/history/) with the
![](/docs/desktop/images/16/172.png) icon.
