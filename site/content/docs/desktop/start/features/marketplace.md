# Marketplace

ZAP Marketplace contains ZAP add-ons which have been written by the ZAP team and the community. The add-ons help to extend the functionalities of ZAP.
You can browse and download add-ons from within ZAP by clicking on the
![](/docs/desktop/images/fugue/block.png) 'Manage Add-ons' button in the toolbar and then selecting the Marketplace tab.

All of the add-ons on the ZAP Marketplace are, of course, free and open source.
