# Tags

A tag is short piece of text that you wish to associate with a request.  
A request can have multiple tags associated with it.  
Tags can be added and changed using the [Manage Tags dialog](/docs/desktop/ui/dialogs/managetags/).  
They can also be automatically added via [Passive scanning](/docs/desktop/start/features/pscan/) -
this allows you to automatically tag pages which match a particular regular expression.  

Tags are shown in the [History tab](/docs/desktop/ui/tabs/history/) and can be filtered on using
the [History Filter dialog](/docs/desktop/ui/dialogs/hist_filter/).
