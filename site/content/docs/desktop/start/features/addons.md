# Add-ons


Add-ons add additional functionality to ZAP.  

They have full access to all of the ZAP internals, and so can provide very powerful new features.  

You can dynamically install add-ons from the online Add-on Marketplace via the
[Manage Add-ons dialog](/docs/desktop/ui/dialogs/manageaddons/).  

You can typically add and remove add-ons to and from the ZAP UI without having to restart it.  


Add-ons can provide context sensitive help which is dynamically integrated with the help file.  

If you are reading this page via a ZAP help file (as opposed to reading it online) then any
help pages associated with the add-ons you have installed will be available under
[here](/docs/desktop/addons/).  


Add-ons are assigned a status which may be one of:

|   |         |                                                                                             |
|---|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   | Release | which indicates they are of high status and fit for purpose                                 |
|   | Beta    | which indicates they are of reasonable status but may be incomplete or need further testing |
|   | Alpha   | which indicates they are at an early stage of development                                   |


### Location of add-ons available to ZAP

To make an add-on available to ZAP it must be in one of the following locations:

* `plugin` directory located in the ZAP's installation folder;
* `plugin` directory located in the ZAP's user folder.
