# Add-ons

Add-ons add additional functionality to ZAP.  
They have full access to all of the ZAP internals, and so can provide very powerful new features.  
You can dynamically install add-ons from the online Add-on Marketplace via the
[Manage Add-ons dialog](/docs/desktop/ui/dialogs/manageaddons/).  
You can typically add and remove add-ons to and from the ZAP UI without having to restart it.

Add-ons can provide context sensitive help which is dynamically integrated with the help file.  
If you are reading this page via a ZAP help file (as opposed to reading it online) then any
help pages associated with the add-ons you have installed will be available under
[here](/docs/desktop/addons/).

Add-ons are assigned a status which may be one of:

|     |         |                                                                                              |
| --- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|     | Release | which indicates they are of high quality and fit for purpose                                 |
|     | Beta    | which indicates they are of reasonable quality but may be incomplete or need further testing |
|     | Alpha   | which indicates they are at an early stage of development                                    |

### Location of add-ons available to ZAP

To make an add-on available to ZAP it must be in one of the following locations:

- `plugin` directory located in the ZAP's installation folder;
- `plugin` directory located in the ZAP's user folder.
