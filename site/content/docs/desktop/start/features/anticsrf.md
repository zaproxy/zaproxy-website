# Anti CSRF Tokens

Anti CSRF tokens are (pseudo) random parameters used to protect against Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.  
However they also make a penetration testers job harder, especially if the tokens are regenerated every time a form is requested.

ZAP detects anti CSRF tokens purely by attribute names - the list of attribute names considered to be anti CSRF tokens
is configured using the [Options Anti CSRF screen](/docs/desktop/ui/dialogs/options/anticsrf/).  
When ZAP detects these tokens it records the token value and which URL generated the token.  
Other scanners, like [active scanner](/docs/desktop/start/features/ascan/), have options which
cause ZAP to automatically regenerate the tokens when required.
