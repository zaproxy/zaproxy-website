# Authentication Methods

ZAP handles multiple types of authentication (called **Authentication
Methods** ) that can be used for websites / webapps. Each **[Context](/docs/desktop/start/features/contexts/)** has an Authentication Method
defined which dictates how authentication is handled. The
authentication is used to create Web Sessions that correspond to
authenticated webapp [Users](/docs/desktop/start/features/users/).

Authentication methods can be used in multiple places around
ZAP. Some of the examples include:

- defining Users and automatic login
- detection of authenticated/unauthenticated states
- performing automatic re-authentication

Multiple authentication methods have been implemented and the
system supports easy addition of new methods, according to user needs.
They main ones are described below.

## Manual Authentication {#manual}

This method allows users to perform the authentication manually
(e.g. authenticate in the browser while proxy-ing through ZAP) and
then select the corresponding HTTP session. As the actual
authentication is being performed by you, this method does not support
re-authentication in case the webapp logs a user out.

When using this authentication method, configuring a User for the context
require choosing an authenticated HTTP session.

## Form-Based Authentication {#formBased}

This method is used for websites / webapps where authentication is
done by submitting a form or performing a GET request to a 'login url'
using a 'username/password' pair of authentication credentials.
Re-authentication is possible. Configuration can be done using the [Session
Contexts Authentication screen](/docs/desktop/ui/dialogs/session/context-auth/) or using the contextual PopupMenu: _Flag as...
Form-Based Authentication Login Request_.

When using this authentication method, configuring a User for the context requires
setting up the _username/password_ pair of credentials that are used for the form based
authentication.

If the application requires submitting the anti-CSRF token presented in the login page, ZAP will
handle it automatically. Make sure the token
name is configured in [Options Anti CSRF screen](/docs/desktop/ui/dialogs/options/anticsrf/).

## JSON-Based Authentication {#jsonBased}

This method is used for websites / webapps where authentication is
done by submitting a JSON object to a 'login url' using a 'username/password'
pair of authentication credentials.
Re-authentication is possible. Configuration can be done using the [Session
Contexts Authentication screen](/docs/desktop/ui/dialogs/session/context-auth/) or using the contextual PopupMenu: _Flag as...
JSON-Based Authentication Login Request_.

When using this authentication method, configuring a User for the context requires
setting up the _username/password_ pair of credentials that are used for the
authentication.

## HTTP/NTLM Authentication {#httpAuth}

This method is used for websites / webapps where authentication is
enforced using the HTTP or NTLM Authentication mechanisms employing HTTP message headers.
Three authentication schemes are supported: Basic, Digest and NTLM.
Re-authentication is possible, as the authentication headers are sent with every authenticated
request. Configuration can be done using the [Session
Contexts Authentication screen](/docs/desktop/ui/dialogs/session/context-auth/).

When using this authentication method, configuring a User for the context requires
setting up the _username/password_ pair of credentials that are used for the HTTP/NTLM authentication.

## Script-Based Authentication {#scriptBased}

This method is useful for websites / webapps where the authentication is a more complex one and some custom
scripts that handle the authentication process are beneficial. To use this method, you must first define an Authentication
[script](/docs/desktop/start/features/scripts/) which sends messages or performs other actions as needed by your web-application.
This script is then selected for use for a given Context
and it is called whenever an authentication is performed. Re-authentication is possible.
Configuration can be done using the [Session Contexts Authentication screen](/docs/desktop/ui/dialogs/session/context-auth/).

When using this authentication method, configuring a User for the context requires
setting up the a set of parameters defined in the script. For more details, see the provided Authentication Script examples.
