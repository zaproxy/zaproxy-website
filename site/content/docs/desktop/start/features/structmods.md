# Structural Modifiers


Structural Modifiers are controls which change how ZAP represents the structure of the application.  

The [Sites Tree](/docs/desktop/start/features/sitestree/) is ZAP's representation of the application.  

If it is not a good representation of the structure then ZAP will not be able to attack the application effectively.  

There are currently 2 types of Structural Modifiers:

* [Data Driven Content](/docs/desktop/start/features/ddc/) which identify URL paths that represent data
* [Structural Parameters](/docs/desktop/start/features/structparams/) which identify parameters that represent application structure instead of user data

Structural Modifiers can only be applied to [Contexts](/docs/desktop/start/features/contexts/).
