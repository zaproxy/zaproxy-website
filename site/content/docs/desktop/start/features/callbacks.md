# Callbacks

Various ZAP components (scan rules, etc) may leverage payloads which result in HTTP requests back to ZAP.
Such callback requests may be triggered by the spider(s), a user, or a future action from a tertiary system.

The ZAP GUI includes a panel in which such requests can be reviewed: [Callbacks tab](/docs/desktop/ui/tabs/callbacks/).
