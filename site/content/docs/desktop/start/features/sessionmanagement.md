# Session Management

ZAP handles multiple types of session management (called **Session
Management Methods** ) that can be used for websites / webapps. Each **[Context](/docs/desktop/start/features/contexts/)** has a Session Management
Method defined which dictates how sessions are kept.

### Cookie-Based Session Management {#cbsm}

In the case of this method the session is being tracked through
cookies. Currently, the session tokens that are used are imported from
the [HTTP Sessions](/docs/desktop/start/features/httpsessions/) Extension.

### HTTP Authentication Session Management {#hasm}

In the case of this method the session is managed with HTTP request header `Authorization`.

### Script-Based Session Management {#sbsm}

This method is useful for websites / webapps where the session management is a more complex one and some custom
scripts that handle the process are beneficial. To use this method, you must first define a Session Management script
which analyses messages or performs other actions as needed by your web-application. This script is then selected for use for a given Context
and it is called whenever session management actions are performed.
Configuration can be done using the [Session
Contexts Dialog](/docs/desktop/ui/dialogs/session/contexts/#sm) and requires you to have the Scripts Console ZAP Addon installed from the Marketplace.
