# Release 1.2.0


The following changes were made in this release:

## Significant changes:

### Memory Leaks

Memory leaks have been fixed in the [active scanner](/docs/desktop/start/features/ascan/) and spider.

### Invoke applications

External applications can now be invoked from the Sites and History tabs.

### Passive Scanner

The [passive scanner](/docs/desktop/start/features/pscan/) now looks for vulnerabilities, such as:

|   |                                         |
|---|-----------------------------------------|
|   | Autocomplete forms with password fields |
|   | Cookies without the 'HttpOnly' flag     |
|   | SSL Cookies without the 'secure' flag   |
|   | Weak authentication                     |

## Minor changes:

### XML Reports

A new 'Generate XML Report...' menu item is now included in the top level [Reports](/docs/desktop/ui/tlmenu/report/) menu.

### Manual Request Editor and Resend dialogs

Requests submitted by the Manual Request Editor and Resend dialogs are now shown in the [Sites](/docs/desktop/ui/tabs/sites/) and [History](/docs/desktop/ui/tabs/history/) tabs.  
A new 'Method' pull down allows you to switch between the HTTP methods, this automatically moves parameters between the URL and the body when a POST method is selected or deselected.

### Alerts UI

The [Sites](/docs/desktop/ui/tabs/sites/) tab now shows any alerts as flags to the right of any node names.  
The alert counts in the [footer](/docs/desktop/ui/footer/) now show the number of different types of alerts rather than the total number of instances.

### Active scanner delay option

The delay in milliseconds between each [active scanner](/docs/desktop/start/features/ascan/) request can now be set via the [Options Active Scan screen](/docs/desktop/ui/dialogs/options/ascan/). This will increase the time an active scan takes but will reduce the load on the target.

### UI Changes

The [Sites](/docs/desktop/ui/tabs/sites/) tab now takes up all of the left hand side - this can be changed back via the [Options Display screen](/docs/desktop/ui/dialogs/options/ascan/) if required.  

The 'toolbar' on the [Request](/docs/desktop/ui/tabs/request/), [Response](/docs/desktop/ui/tabs/response/) and [Break](/docs/desktop/ui/tabs/break/) tabs and the Manual Request Editor and Resend dialogs is now at the top rather than the bottom.  

The scanner counts in the [footer](/docs/desktop/ui/footer/) are now displayed on the right hand side.
