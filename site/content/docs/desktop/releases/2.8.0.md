# Release 2.8.0

This is a bug fix and enhancement release, which requires a minimum of Java 8. Note that a minimum of Java 11 is recommended, especially for high DPI displays.

These release notes do not include all of the changes included in add-ons updated since 2.7.0.

Some of the more significant enhancements include:

## Heads Up Display

The ZAP Heads Up Display (HUD) brings all of the essential ZAP functionality into your browser. It is ideal for people new to web security and also allows experienced penetration testers to focus on an application's features while providing key security information and functionality.  
The HUD can be enabled when proxying a browser through ZAP via the new 'Manual Explore' screen and a top level toolbar button.

## Quick Start Screens

The Quick Start tab has been reworked to provide 3 screens:

- Automated Scan: allows you to launch an automated scan against an application and the choice of traditional and/or ajax spider
- Manual Explore: allows you to launch browsers configured to proxy via ZAP with the option to enable the HUD
- Learn More: provides links to local and remote resources which you can use to learn more about ZAP

The tab also provides a news panel that provides a summary of ZAP news along with a link for more details. News items can be hidden when no longer needed.

## Scan Rule Promotions

The following scan rules have been promoted:

### Active Scan Rules - Release

- Promote Source Code Disclosure WEB-INF (Issue 4448).

### Passive Scan Rules - Release

- Promote Charset Mismatch Scanner to release (Issue 4460).
- Promote ViewState Scanner to release (Issue 4453).
- Promote Insecure JSF ViewState Scanner to release (Issue 4455).
- Promote Insecure Authentication Scanner to release (Issue 4456).
- Promote Information Disclosure Debug Errors Scanner to release (Issue 4457).
- Promote CSRF Countermeasures Scanner to release (Issue 4458).
- Promote Cookie Loosely Scoped Scanner to release (Issue 4459).

## Headless Browser Support

Headless browsers are now supported by the Selenium add-on and the add-ons that use it. Both the Ajax Spider and the DOM XSS scan rule now default to headless Firefox.

## Command Line Changes

### -dir \<dir\>

To prevent add-ons (inadvertently) use/override core files ZAP will no longer start (and show an error) if the home and the installation directories are the same.

### CA Certificate Handling

The following options allow the root CA certificate to be set and read:

```
-certload <path>      Loads the Root CA certificate from the specified file name
-certpubdump <path>   Dumps the Root CA public certificate into the specified file name, this is suitable for importing into browsers
-certfulldump <path>  Dumps the Root CA full certificate (including the private key) into the specified file name, this is suitable for importing into ZAP
```

These options are particularly useful when running ZAP headless in Docker, as they allow you to either specify the CA certificate to use or to access the one that ZAP creates automatically for you.

### Client Certificate Handling

It is now possible to set the Client Certificate from the command line with the following switches:

```
-config certificate.use=true
-config certificate.pkcs12.path=/path/to/file.p12
-config certificate.pkcs12.password=WhateverThePasswordIs
-config certificate.pkcs12.index=1
-config certificate.persist=true
```

`-config certificate.pkcs12.index` is only necessary if the file contains multiple certificates
and you wish to use one other than the first. Index values start at zero (0) which is the first certificate
in the file.

`-config certificate.persist=true` is only necessary if you would like the settings persisted in ZAP's regular
configuration file (so that they apply for subsequent ZAP use).

## Source Code Restructuring

The ZAP repositories have all been migrated to use Gradle from Ant. Standard source code formatting is also now enforced for consistency.

## Filters Removal

Deprecated since ZAP 2.4.0 the Filters functionality, that allowed to change/access some HTTP messages sent/received through ZAP, has now been removed, the same and much more can be achieved with scripts and Replacer add-on.

## Changes in Bundled Libraries

The following libraries are no longer being bundled with ZAP (core):

- BrowserLauncher2, it was replaced with the usage of JRE class `java.awt.Desktop`. Add-ons should use that class or bundle the library.
- HttpComponents Client/Core, no longer in use by core, any add-ons that require them should bundle them.
- JavaFX runtime, now relying on JRE (for example, OracleJDK, OpenJDK+OpenJFX).

The following libraries will be removed in a future release:

- JDOM
- Diff Utils

no longer in use by core, add-ons should bundle the library, if needed. The following libraries were updated:

- Bouncy Castle, 1.52 → 1.61
- Commons BeanUtils, 1.8.3 → 1.9.3
- Commons Codec, 1.9 → 1.12
- Commons Configuration, 1.9 → 1.10
- Commons CSV, 1.1 → 1.6
- Commons IO, 2.4 → 2.6
- Commons Lang, 3.7 → 3.9
- Commons Text, 1.3 → 1.6
- HSQLDB, 2.3.4 → 2.4.1
- Java SemVer, 0.8.0 → 0.9.0
- Jericho HTML Parser, 3.1 → 3.4
- RSyntaxTextArea, 2.5.8 → 3.0.3
- SQLite JDBC, 3.8.11.1 → 3.27.2.1
- SwingX, 1.6.4 → 1.6.5-1

## Active Scan Input Vectors Change

Users now have the option of whether or not to add a query parameter to GET requests that did not have them to start with. In previous versions this behavior was not user controllable and was on by default. With the new user option the default has been changed to off.

## JSON Authentication Method

An authentication method has been added which allows a JSON object to be sent in the request body.

## JSON Report Change

For consistency the `site` property will be always an array regardless of the number of sites that the report contains, previously it would be an object if only one site and an array if more than one.

## Display Options - Font Controls

In the Options dialog Display panel it is now possible for the user to select a General font and size for ZAPs GUI, as well as a Work Panel font and size used for the top right section of ZAP's main window (Ex: Request/Response, the Edit and Resend tool, etc.).

## ZAP API Breaking Changes:

### VIEW acsrf / optionTokensNames

This change will break the consumers that were manually parsing/extracting the names from the string. The structure of the data returned was changed to properly separate each name:

>     {"optionTokensNames":["anticsrf","CSRFToken"]}

and:

>     <optionTokensNames type="list">
>         <tokenName>anticsrf</tokenName>
>         <tokenName>CSRFToken</tokenName>
>     </optionTokensNames>

instead of:

>     {"TokensNames":"[anticsrf, CSRFToken]"}

and:

>     <optionTokensNames>[anticsrf, CSRFToken]</optionTokensNames>

### VIEW authentication / getAuthenticationMethod

This change will break the consumers that were manually parsing/extracting the JSON response (and XML response, for manual authentication method). The structure of the data was changed to have an object wrap the authentication method data, to be consistent with all other views. The returned data would be, for example:

>     {
>       "method": {
>         "port": "443",
>         "host": "example.com",
>         "methodName": "httpAuthentication",
>         "realm": "example"
>       }
>     }

instead of:

>     {
>       "port": "443",
>       "host": "example.com",
>       "methodName": "httpAuthentication",
>       "realm": "example"
>     }

### VIEW core / alertsSummary

This change will break the consumers that were manually parsing/extracting the JSON response. The structure of the data was changed to have an object wrap the alerts summary, to be consistent with all other views. The returned data would be, for example:

>     {
>       "alertsSummary": {
>         "High": 0,
>         "Low": 3,
>         "Medium": 1,
>         "Informational": 1
>       }
>     }

instead of:

>     {
>       "High": 0,
>       "Low": 3,
>       "Medium": 1,
>       "Informational": 1
>     }

### VIEW core / alerts

The view will now validate the risk ID, returning an error (ILLEGAL_PARAMETER) if not valid.

### VIEW core / numberOfAlerts

The view will now validate the risk ID, returning an error (ILLEGAL_PARAMETER) if not valid.

## ZAP API Deprecated Endpoints:

All alert related core endpoints were deprecated, they are now accessible through a new component `alert`.

## ZAP API Changed Endpoints:

### ACTION authentication / setAuthenticationMethod

The action will no longer remove existing users, instead the user is disabled and its credentials reset if the type of credentials of the authentication method being set is different.

### ACTION context / excludeContextTechnologies

The action will now accept the string with technologies even if there are spaces before or after the names, for example:

>     os.linux, db.mysql

will now be valid.

### ACTION context / includeContextTechnologies

The action will now accept the string with technologies even if there are spaces before or after the names, for example:

>     os.linux, db.mysql

will now be valid.

### ACTION core / snapshotSession

Added optional parameters `name` and `overwrite`, to allow to specify a name and overwrite existing files.
