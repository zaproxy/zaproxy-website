# Release 2.10.0

This is a 10 year anniversary bug fix and enhancement release, which requires a minimum of Java 8. Note that a minimum of Java 11 is recommended, especially for high DPI displays.   

These release notes do not include all of the changes included in add-ons updated since 2.9.0.   

Some of the more significant enhancements include:

### Custom Pages

[Custom Pages](/docs/desktop/start/features/custompages/) can be defined on a per context basis - these allow ZAP to identify various non-standard error handling conditions such as custom error pages and handle them more effectively.

### Authentication Polling

The concept of [Authentication Verification Strategies](/docs/desktop/start/features/authstrategies/) has been introduced which allows ZAP to handle a wider range of authentication mechanisms including the option to poll a specified page for the authentication status of a user.

### Site Tree Control

Scripts and add-ons now have full access to how nodes are represented in the [Sites Tree](/docs/desktop/start/features/sitestree/). Both [Input Vector Scripts](https://github.com/zaproxy/community-scripts/tree/main/variant) and add-ons which include implementations of the [Variant](https://static.javadoc.io/org.zaproxy/zap/2.10.0/org/parosproxy/paros/core/scanner/Variant.html) class can change both the tree structure and names used for new nodes.   

For more details see the [Site Tree Modifiers](/blog/2020-09-22-sites-tree-modifiers/) Blog post.

### Dynamic Look and Feel including Dark Mode

The Desktop UI includes a new set of open source Look and Feel's c/o [FlatLaf](https://github.com/JFormDesigner/FlatLaf) including 2 Dark Mode options.  
You can also dynamically switch the Look and Feel via a button on the [Top Level Toolbar](/docs/desktop/ui/tltoolbar/).   

For more details of the dark mode see the [Dark Mode in the Weekly Release](/blog/2020-03-04-dark-mode-in-the-weekly-release/) Blog post.

### Authentication Headers via Env Vars

A new set of environmental variables are available which allow you to easily add an authentication header to all of the requests that are proxied through ZAP or initiated by the ZAP tools, including the spiders and active scanner. These are documented on the [Authentication](/docs/desktop/start/features/authentication/#envvars) page.

### SOCKS Proxy Configuration

It is now possible to dynamically configure the outgoing SOCKS proxy in the Options' Connection screen. By default the SOCKS proxy configuration applies to all connections made by ZAP.

### Cached Scripts

The following script types are now cached between invocations reducing the time it takes to reuse them:

* Active Rules
* HTTP Sender
* Input Vectors, when used for the Sites tree
* Passive Rules
* Proxy

## Add-Ons

### New Add-Ons

The following add-ons are included by default in this release for the first time:

* [Advanced Encode / Decode / Hash dialog](/docs/desktop/addons/encode-decode-hash/) - this replaces the old core encode/decode/hash dialog

* Update zap-api-scan.py to add support for GraphQL.
* Fail immediately if the spider scans were not started to provide better error message.
* Packaged scans will use the provided context when spidering and active scanning.

* Removed python 2, only python 3 will be supported going forward.

For example, the logger can now be obtained with:

```java
import org.apache.logging.log4j.LogManager;
import org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger;

// ...

Logger logger = LogManager.getLogger(MyClass.class);
```
