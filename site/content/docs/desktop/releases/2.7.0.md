# Release 2.7.0

This is a bug fix and enhancement release, which requires a minimum of Java 8.

Some of the more significant enhancements include:

- Browser launch included by default - this allows you to launch browsers from ZAP that are preconfigured to proxy through ZAP and ignore the certificate warnings due to the ZAP root certificate.
- Allow ZAP to listen on multiple addresses/ports
- Support Server Name Indication
- Updated NTLM engine implementation - this fixes the cases where the domain is being validated and improves interoperability with other (server) NTLM implementations
- Lots of new API endpoints - see below for details

Note that if you do have any problems with this release then there is also a new 'Help/Support Info...' menu item that provides essential information about your ZAP installation which you should include with any issues you raise.

## ZAP API Breaking Changes:

### ACTION authentication / setAuthenticationMethod

The authentication type "formBasedAuthentication" will now require the login URL always in encoded form. The change ensures the login URL is used/sent as it was specified. Previously it would accept partially encoded URLs but they would be re-encoded when used, potentially leading to a different URL being used/sent.

### VIEW context / contextList

This change will break the consumers that were manually parsing/extracting the names from the string. The structure of the data returned was changed to properly separate each name:

>     {"contextList":["Context 1","Context 2"]}

and:

>     <contextList type="list">
>         <contextName>Context 1</contextName>
>         <contextName>Context 2</contextName>
>     </contextList>

instead of:

>     {"contextList":"[Context 1, Context 2]"}

and:

>     <contextList>[Context 1, Context 2]</contextList>

### VIEW core / setOptionUseProxyChain

Changed to return `FAIL` if the outgoing proxy was not enabled (because the required address/hostname was not previously set), before it would return always `OK`.

## ZAP API Changed Endpoints:

### VIEW core / alerts

Added optional riskId parameter to facilitate filtering the risk. Where riskId is in the range 0 for Informational and 3 for High.

### VIEW core / numberOfAlerts

Added optional riskId parameter to facilitate filtering the risk. Where riskId is in the range 0 for Informational and 3 for High.

### VIEW core / urls

Added optional `baseurl` parameter, to filter the URLs that are returned.

### VIEW ascan / scans

Changed to also return the total number of alerts raised and messages sent during each scan.

### VIEW ascan / scanProgress

Changed to also return the number of alerts raised by each scanner.

## ZAP API New Endpoints:

### VIEW core / alertsSummary

A new summary view for Alerts which displays counts of Alerts per Risk level. Optionally, filtered by a baseurl value.

>     {"High":0,"Low":132,"Medium":39,"Informational":153}

### VIEW core / messagesById

### ACTION core / deleteAlert

Deletes the alert with the given ID.

### ACTION core / setOptionAlertOverridesFilePath

Sets (or clears, if empty) the path to the file with alert overrides.

### ACTION core / setOptionMaximumAlertInstances

### Windows Uninstaller Vulnerable to DLL Hijacking

The ZAP Windows Uninstaller for 2.6.0 is vulnerable to DLL Hijacking on Windows. This was a vulnerability in the 3rd party installer Install4j which has now been fixed.  
Note that this can only occur if a malicious DLL is already on the path.
