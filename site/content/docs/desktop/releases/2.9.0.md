# Release 2.9.0

This is a bug fix and enhancement release, which requires a minimum of Java 8. Note that a minimum of Java 11 is recommended, especially for high DPI displays.

These release notes do not include all of the changes included in add-ons updated since 2.8.0.

Some of the more significant enhancements include:

## Session Management Scripts

It's now possible to define scripts which handle non standard or more complex session management.  
Session Management scripts have full access to the authentication request and response and can define custom mandatory and optional parameters. An example session management script for OWASP Juice shop is provided.

## Active Scan Filter

It's now possible to filter requests in Active Scan. Below are the supported criteria's:

- HTTP method
- Status code
- Tags
- URL pattern

## Custom Global/Script Variables

It's now possible for scripts to share custom global/script variables, which can be of any type not just strings, for example, lists, maps, GUI models.  
In JavaScript they are accessed/set as follows:

>     var ScriptVars = Java.type("org.zaproxy.zap.extension.script.ScriptVars")
>
>     ScriptVars.setScriptCustomVar(this.context, "var.name", {x: 1, y: 3})
>     print(ScriptVars.getScriptCustomVar(this.context, "var.name").y) // Prints 3
>
>     ScriptVars.setGlobalCustomVar("var.name", ["A", "B", "C", "D"])
>     print(ScriptVars.getGlobalCustomVar("var.name")[2]) // Prints C

## Scan Rule Promotions
