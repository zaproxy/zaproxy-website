# Release 2.5.0

The following changes were made in this release:

## ZAP API Changes:

### VIEW authorization / getAuthorizationDetectionMethod

Now returns data wrapped in an object called authorizationDetectionMethod For example:

```
{"authorizationDetectionMethod":{"statusCode":"-1"..."headerRegex":""}}
```

instead of:

```
{"statusCode":"-1"..."headerRegex":""}
```

### VIEW context / context + technologyList

Both now return data wrapped in an object called "context" For example:

```
{"context":{"id":"1", ..., "inScope":"true","loggedOutPattern":""}}
```

instead of:

```
{"id":"1", ..., "inScope":"true","loggedOutPattern":""}
```

### ACTION spider / scan + scanAsUser

Both now support a new optional 'subtreeOnly' parameter which limits the spider to the specified subtree. The 'url' parameter is also now optional, as long as a valid 'context' parameter is supplied

### New 'stats' component

The new 'stats' API component provides access to the [stats](/docs/desktop/start/features/stats/) now maintained by ZAP.

Note that some existing components will also have new operations, see the [API Web UI](/docs/desktop/start/features/api/) for more details.
