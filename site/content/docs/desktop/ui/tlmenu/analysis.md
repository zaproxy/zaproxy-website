# The Analyse menu

This menu handles the scan policy.


The spider and scan options that were in this menu in an earlier version are now available via the
[Sites tab](/docs/desktop/ui/tabs/sites/) 'Right click' menu.

### Scan Policy Manager...

This displays the [Scan Policy Manager dialog](/docs/desktop/ui/dialogs/scanpolicymgr/).


Note that [add-ons](/docs/desktop/start/features/addons/) can add additional menu items.
