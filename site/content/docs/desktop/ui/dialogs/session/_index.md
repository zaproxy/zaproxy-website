# Session Properties dialog

This allows you to set the session properties and is made up of the following screens:

### General

This allows you to set the session name and description.

### Exclude from Proxy

This allows you to manage the URLs which will be ignored by the local proxies.

### Exclude from Scanner

This allows you to manage the URLs which will be ignored by the scanner.

### Exclude from Spider

This allows you to manage the URLs which will be ignored by the spiders (standard and AJAX).

### Contexts

A set of screens for managing [contexts](/docs/desktop/start/features/contexts/)

## URL regexs

In the \*Exclude from \*\* dialogs, you can enter regular expressions to define excluded URLs. While you can escape a single meta-character with a backslash, you can also use the **\\Q...\\E** escape sequence. All the characters between the **\\Q** and the **\\E** are interpreted as literal characters. E.g. \\Q\*\\d+\*\\E matches the literal text \*\\d+\*. This escape sequence is used in ZAP when you exclude URLs via some context menus.  
**Note:** If your URL contains a "\\E", then you have to do the following steps when using the **\\Q...\\E** escape sequence:

- Open the escape sequence
- Close the escape sequence before the "character" \\E
- Escape the backslash
- Open after the "\\E" another escape sequence;
- Close the escape sequence as normally would.

Example: subdomain.example.com/path?a=**\\E** \&moredata=2 should appear as _\\Qsubdomain.example.com/path?a=\\E_ **\\\\E** _\\Q\&moredata=2\\E_
