# Options language screen

The language screen allows you to configure:

### Language selection

The language ZAP uses for its display.  
A set of languages are built into ZAP, however more languages may be available after the last release.  
Check the ZAP download page for the latest language pack available.  

### Use system's locale for formatting

If the formatting of numbers, dates, and times is done with the system's locale instead of the locale of the selected language.

### Language pack import

Besides the selection of the language that is used for ZAP's display, the import tool enables you to import new language packs or language file updates. A language file pack will always have the extension *zaplang* . (E.g. language-pack-en_GB.zaplang)   
After the import you will immediately be able to select the newly imported language from the language selection drop down menu on the top of the screen.   
**Note that you will need to restart ZAP in order to finally apply the new language.**
