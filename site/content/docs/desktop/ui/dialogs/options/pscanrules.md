# Options Passive Scan Rules Screen

This screen allows you to configure the [passive scan](/docs/desktop/start/features/pscan/) rules.

### Threshold

This controls how likely ZAP is to report potential vulnerabilities.

- If you select Off then the scanner won't run.
- If you select Low then more potential issues will be raised which may increase the number of false positives.
- If you select High then fewer potential issues will be raised which may mean that some real issues are missed (false negatives).
