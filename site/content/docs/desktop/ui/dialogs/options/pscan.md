# Options Passive Scan Tags screen

This screen allows you to configure the [tags](/docs/desktop/start/features/tags/)
that are added by the [passive scanner](/docs/desktop/start/features/pscan/).
You can add, modify and remove the tags via the appropriate buttons.

## Tag Interpolation

In order to allow some flexibility in Tag creation and content it is possible for the user to specify a regular expression with capturing groups which will be used to replace the group identifiers (ex: $1) in the resulting tag.

For example, a tag could be defined as follows:

| Field                | Value      | Note                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name:                | Test       |                                                                      |
| Tag:                 | $1-SOMETAG |                                                                      |
| Response Body Regex: | (\\d{3})   | Find strings of 3 numbers, using a capturing group (round brackets). |

**Result:** When 3 digit strings are passively identified in response body content (the regex matches) the messages will be tagged such as "123-SOMETAG", "345-SOMETAG", etc.
