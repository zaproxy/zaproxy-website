# Options Alerts screen


This screen allows you to configure the alerts options:

### Merge related alerts in report

If selected then related issues will be merged in any reports generated.  
This will significantly reduce the size of the report as duplicated information will be removed.

### Max alert instances in report

The maximum number of alert instances to include in a report.  
A value of zero is treated as unlimited.

### Alert overrides file

The full name of a properties file that specifies any [alert overrides](/docs/desktop/start/features/alerts/#alertoverrides) that you want to apply.
