# Options HTTP Sessions screen

This screen allows you to configure the [HTTP Sessions
Extension's](/docs/desktop/start/features/httpsessions/) options:

### Default Tokens

These are the names of the Cookies that are considered by default to be session tokens. As soon they are detected as parameters on a Site, they are automatically added as session tokens for that Site, unless manually overriden by user command.

The session tokens are used case-insensitive, therefore the
default session tokens will automatically be lower-cased. Also, any
modifications of the default session tokens are visible only after the
revisit of the Site's pages.

### Enable for Proxy only

If this option is enabled, the Extension will only process the messages sent and received through the Proxy (e.g. from/to the browser). The messages from other Extensions are processed only if this option is disabled.
