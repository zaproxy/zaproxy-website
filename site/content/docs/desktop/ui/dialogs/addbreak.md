# Add/Edit Breakpoint dialog

This dialogue allows you to add and edit [HTTP breakpoints](/docs/desktop/start/features/breakpoints/).

A breakpoint is defined by the following fields:

- **Location** - where the `String` is checked in the HTTP message: `URL`, `Request Header`, `Request Body`, `Response Header`, or `Response Body`.
- **Match** - how the `String` is interpreted, `Regex` or `Contains`, for regular expression or exact match, respectively, in the `Location`. The regular expression does not need to match the whole content of the `Location`.
- **String** - the string that triggers the breakpoint.
- **Inverse** - if the result of the `Match` should be the inverse.
- **Ignore case** - if the case of the `String` should be ignored.

If you proxy a HTTP message that matches a breakpoint then ZAP will intercept it and allow you to change either the request and/or the response.

**Note:** ZAP will warn and prevent adding breakpoints with a fragment identifier component (`#`), if
the breakpoint has match `Contains` and location `URL`. Such breakpoint would not work because the
fragment identifier is not sent to the server.
