# Scan Policy Manager dialog


This allows you to manage the [scan policies](/docs/desktop/start/features/scanpolicy/) that define the rules that are run when
performing an [active scan](/docs/desktop/start/features/ascan/).  

You can have as many scan policies as you like, and choose which one of them is run when you perform an active scan.

### Add

The Add button launches the [Scan Policy dialog](/docs/desktop/ui/dialogs/scanpolicy/) with all of the settings defaulted.

### Modify

The Modify button launches the [Scan Policy dialog](/docs/desktop/ui/dialogs/scanpolicy/) with all of the selected scan policy.

### Remove

The Remove button deletes the selected scan policy if you confirm the warning dialog.

### Import

The Import button allows you to import a scan policy created by another instance of ZAP.

### Export


The Export button allows you to export a scan policy so that you can import it into another instance of ZAP,
which can be on another machine.
