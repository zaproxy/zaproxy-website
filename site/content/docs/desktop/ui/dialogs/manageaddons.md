# Manage Add-ons


This allows you to manage the [add-ons](/docs/desktop/start/features/addons/)
that you have installed and download new ones from the Add-on Marketplace.


Two tabs are available:

## Installed

This tab shows you the version of ZAP you are running, all of the installed add-ons and allows you to check for any updates to ZAP or any of the add-ons.  
Hovering over an add-on will show you more information about it.   
You can also uninstall add-ons from this tab - typically add-ons are dynamically removed from the ZAP UI as soon as you uninstall them.

## Marketplace

This tab shows you all of the add-ons that you don't have installed which are available from the Add-on Marketplace.  
You will need to 'Check for Updates' before you can see the add-ons available.  
Hovering over an add-on will show you more information about it.   
You can install any of the add-ons listed - typically add-ons are dynamically added to the ZAP UI as soon as you install them.

## Manual loading

When working in a disconnected environment, you may want to manually download and install an add-on.   
All add-ons in the marketplace can be downloaded from the [Marketplace page](/addons/). Downloaded add-ons can be loaded to ZAP via the [File](/docs/desktop/ui/tlmenu/file/) menu.
