# Breakpoints tab

The Breakpoints tab shows you all of the
[breakpoints](/docs/desktop/start/features/breakpoints/) that you have set.  

Breakpoints can be set via the [History](/docs/desktop/ui/tabs/history/) and
[Sites](/docs/desktop/ui/tabs/sites/) tabs as well as the 'Add a custom HTTP breakpoint' button on the
[top level toolbar](/docs/desktop/ui/tltoolbar/)

## Right click menu

Right clicking on a breakpoint will bring up a menu which will allow you to:

### Edit...

This will bring up the 'Edit breakpoint' dialog which allows you to edit the criteria that defines the breakpoint. Double clicking on the breakpoint will also show this dialog.

### Remove

This will remove the breakpoint
