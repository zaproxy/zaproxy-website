# Alerts tab

The Alerts tab show the [Alerts](/docs/desktop/start/features/alerts/)
that have been raised in this session.
The alerts are displayed in a tree in risk order in the left hand pane, and each
node of the tree shows the total number of alerts underneath it.

Selecting an alert with one click will display it in the right hand pane.
Double clicking an alert will display the [Add Alert](/docs/desktop/ui/dialogs/addalert/)
dialog which will allow you to change the alert details.

## Filtering alerts

The filter buttons, shown immediately above the tree, allows you to restrict which alerts are displayed:

### ![](/docs/desktop/images/fugue/target.png) / ![](/docs/desktop/images/fugue/target-grey.png) Show only URLs in Scope / Show all URLs

Allows to show only the alerts of URLs that are in [scope](/docs/desktop/start/features/scope/).

### ![](/docs/desktop/images/16/094.png) / ![](/docs/desktop/images/16/earth-grey.png) Link / Unlink with Sites selection

Allows to show only the alerts of the [Sites tab](/docs/desktop/ui/tabs/sites/) selected tree node.

**Note:** Selecting one filter will disable the other as they are mutually
exclusive.

### ![](/docs/desktop/images/16/018.png) Edit Alert

Will display the [Add Alert](/docs/desktop/ui/dialogs/addalert/) dialog which will allow you to change the alert details, for the selected alert.

**Note:** If multiple alerts are selected in the tree, the most recently selected
item is edited.

### ![](/docs/desktop/images/fugue/broom-alerts.png) Delete All Alerts

Allows to delete all alerts.

## Right click menu

Right clicking on a node will bring up a menu which will allow you to:

### Open/Resend with Request Editor...

This will bring up the [Manual Request Editor dialog](/docs/desktop/ui/dialogs/man_req/) which allows you to resend the request associated with the alert after making any changes to it that you want to.
