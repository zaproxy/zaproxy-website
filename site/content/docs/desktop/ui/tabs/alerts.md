# Alerts tab


The Alerts tab show the [Alerts](/docs/desktop/start/features/alerts/)
that have been raised in this session.
The alerts are displayed in a tree in risk order in the left hand pane, and each
node of the tree shows the total number of alerts underneath it.


Selecting an alert with one click will display it in the right hand pane.
Double clicking an alert will display the [Add Alert](/docs/desktop/ui/dialogs/addalert/)
dialog which will allow you to change the alert details.

## Filtering alerts

The filter buttons, shown immediately above the tree, allows you to restrict which alerts are displayed:

Allows to show only the alerts of URLs that are in [scope](/docs/desktop/start/features/scope/).

### ![](/docs/desktop/images/16/094.png) / ![](/docs/desktop/images/16/earth-grey.png) Link / Unlink with Sites selection

### ![](/docs/desktop/images/16/018.png) Edit Alert

Will display the [Add Alert](/docs/desktop/ui/dialogs/addalert/) dialog which will allow you to change the alert details, for the selected alert.
