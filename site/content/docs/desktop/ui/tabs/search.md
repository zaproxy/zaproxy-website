# Search tab

The Search tab allows you to search for regular expressions in all of the
URLs, requests, responses, headers and in other functionalities provided by add-ons.

Enter the regular expression you would like to search for in the search
box and either press return or click on the search button:
![](/docs/desktop/images/16/049.png)

A pull down allows you to choose whether to search across the URLs,
the requests, the responses or everything.

All URLs, requests or responses which contain the search pattern will
be displayed in the tab.  
You may find it useful to add .\* to your search term -
this will give you more context e.g. password.\*

You can use the
![](/docs/desktop/images/16/107.png) Next and
![](/docs/desktop/images/16/108.png) Previous
buttons to view found search terms in the [Request](/docs/desktop/ui/tabs/request/)
and [Response tabs](/docs/desktop/ui/tabs/response/).

You can also go directly to a specific instance by clicking on the relevant
line in the results list.
