# Request tab

The Request tab shows you the data sent by your browser for the request that you have
highlighted in either the [Sites tab](/docs/desktop/ui/tabs/sites/) or the
[History tab](/docs/desktop/ui/tabs/history/).  
The top panel shows the request header and the bottom panel shows any data also sent, for
example as a result of a POST request.

Pull downs allow you to select different [Views](/docs/desktop/ui/views/) for the Request header and body.

## Right click menu

Right clicking on a node will bring up a menu which will allow you to:

### Find...

This will bring up the [Find dialog](/docs/desktop/ui/dialogs/find/).

### Copy

This will copy the selected string to the clipboard.
