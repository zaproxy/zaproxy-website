# Response tab

The Response tab shows you the data sent to your browser for the request that you have
highlighted in either the [Sites tab](/docs/desktop/ui/tabs/sites/) or the
[History tab](/docs/desktop/ui/tabs/history/).

Pull downs allow you to select different [Views](/docs/desktop/ui/views/) for the Response header and body.

Note that images are only shown in the [History tab](/docs/desktop/ui/tabs/history/)
if the 'Enable Image in History' flag in the [View menu](/docs/desktop/ui/tlmenu/view/) is selected.

## Right click menu

Right clicking on a node will bring up a menu which will allow you to:

### Find...

This will bring up the [Find dialog](/docs/desktop/ui/dialogs/find/).

### Copy

This will copy the selected string to the clipboard.
