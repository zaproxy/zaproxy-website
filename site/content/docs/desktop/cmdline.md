# Command Line

To run ZAP via the command line, you will need to locate the ZAP startup script.  
**Windows:**

```
C:\Program Files (x86)\OWASP\Zed Attack Proxy\zap.bat
```

**Note:** The command line options are not used by the executable (`zap.exe`) only the bat file.

**Mac:**

```
/Applications/OWASP\ ZAP.app/Contents/Java/zap.sh
```

**Linux:**  
`zap.sh` will be below the directory where ZAP was installed.

Alternatively, you can run the JAR file directly:

```
java -jar zap.jar
```

All options below can be passed to any of these.

## Options

ZAP supports the following command line options:

The options `-session` and `-newsession` are mutually exclusive. An error will be shown and ZAP exit (if not in GUI) when both options are set.  
Relative paths to session file are resolved against the "session" directory located in ZAP's home directory (default or specified with `-dir` option).  
Configuration keys should be specified using the dot notation based their location in the XML of the configuration file, eg:

```
<zap-script> -config api.key=12345 -config connection.timeoutInSecs=60
```

Note that add-ons can add extra command line options.

Examples:

- Start ZAP in 'daemon' mode with a new session created at a given path:

  ```
  <zap-script> -daemon -newsession session
  ```

- Create a report of the last scan of an existing session and exit ZAP once finished:

  ```
  <zap-script> -last_scan_report /full/path/to/save/report.xml -session /full/path/to/existing/session -cmd
  ```
